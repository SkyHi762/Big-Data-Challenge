Challenge in partnership with Rolls-Royce' RÂ² Data Labs, the Emergent Alliance and others including Microsoft, Google Cloud, IBM.

The goal was to analyse massive real-world datasets to deliver insights that will support the push for sustainability in a post-Covid world. My teams focus was on improving air quality and the rise of ESG companies in a post-Covid world.
As a finalist piece, this work was implemented into the Emergent Alliance mission statement and is being pitched to investors.
